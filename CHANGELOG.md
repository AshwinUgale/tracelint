# Changelog

All notable changes to tracelint are documented here. This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) (pre-1.0: minor versions may introduce
additive features; the public API is not yet frozen).

## [Unreleased]

- _Nothing yet._

## [0.2.1]

- Deterministic agent-trace linter: flags schema-violating tool calls, ignored tool
  errors, hallucinated arguments, loops, and redundant calls — each with the exact trace
  lines as evidence and a CI exit code. No model ever judges the trace.
- Canonical trace schema + adapters for OpenTelemetry / OpenInference, the OpenAI SDK,
  and Langfuse.
- Fault injector + per-fault recovery scorecard.
- Keyless `tracelint demo` validation suite (one planted instance of every defect, clean
  controls, and legitimate-but-suspicious cases) with a live HTML report.
